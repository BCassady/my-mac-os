# My wonderful world of macOS

> Greatly inspired by Nikita Voloboev's [my-mac-os](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/my-mac-os/), so please check it out.

> Light appearance. I have macOS setup to automatically switch between light and dark theme between the day and night. I prefer *most* apps to be light theme during the day.

> Dark appearance. Most are in one desktop since there is delay in switching between macOS multiple desktops, I only use a second desktop when working with VMs. Dock is always shown. Desktop background is dynamic based on theme.

## Applications

I use a **lot of apps** on my mac. Below is a list of my favorite tools with descriptions of how I use them.

I hope to one day share my dotfiles, at the moment I am too lazy to find them all.

### Productivity

- Alfred is a powerful launcher that you can program to show anything you want. It saves me a lot of time as I use it to search through anything instantly. Alfred also supports an abundance of workflows which I use many of. There are many more features to Alfred, much more than I can list here.
